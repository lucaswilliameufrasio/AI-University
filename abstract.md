Supervised learning, as known as Supervised Machine Learning, is a
subcategory of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We can define the
application by the usage of the dataset featured to train algorithms that classify
data or predict results with accuracy. There are different methods of Machine
Learning and different datasets, there are different methods that fit better. In
this work, we applied the methodologies of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
and Neural Network, and to analyze the performance of these methodologies,
we had used the Cross-Validation technique, the K Fold Cross-Validation. This
analysis infers that the data to be used has to be analyzed to choose accordingly
the methodologies, as we aim to obtain better results, and the data organization,
in this case, does not have a big relevance.
